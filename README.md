Indigo - Forgotten greets
===

Released at [The Gathering 2014](http://gathering.org), placed 4th in the combined demo/intro competition.

Written in Uno, features a lot of cubes! We tried experimenting with the batcher, which is a really powerful tool allowing you to generate huge geometries and draw everything in one drawm call, increasing your performance dramatically.

In one of the scene we went kind of mental, and animate 100k cubes through wowfactory. This gives us a total of 100k cubes in motion with SSAO and lighting - kinda awesome!

Download the demo and check it out [here](http://demozoo.org/productions/109261/)! We hope to have a WebGL build ready sometime soon.

Use the code as you want, but the soundtrack is ours! :)
