Indigo
====================

Welcome to the Indigo open source demo repo!

Do as you want with the code, but we claim all rights to the resources like Music, Models and Textures.

You'll find the productions separated into branches. If there's a prod you don't find here, please take contact and it'll either be put up, or you'll get a reason for why it's not here :)

Check us out on [Demozoo.org](http://demozoo.org/groups/21222/)!
